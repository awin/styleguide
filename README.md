Style Guide
===========

Official Style guide for all Awin projects. Serves as a reference for
Development by providing a markup pattern library for common UI elements.

Development Lifecycle
=====================

Test your work locally with standard makefile workflow: `make` to build, `make
start` to host, `make run` to poke in a fresh container, `make exec` to poke
into a running one.

In `src/app.ts` you will see files from `src/css`, `src/js` and a few node_modudes being imported.
Webpack is processing the files in `src/app.ts` to generate a bundle which consists of 2 files: `awin.css` and `awin.js`
These files are placed in `public/dist` folder. 
The url for the main awin.css file is:
`//styleguide.awin.com/dist/awin.js`

If you need to include more js or css files into the bundle you need to import them in `src/app.ts` 
Webpack will concatenate and minify all the css files listed in `src/app.ts` into the `awin.css` and all the js files
 into `awin.js`

This project is automatically built and deployed with Jenkins
