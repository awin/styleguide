Style Guide
===========

Official Style guide for all Awin projects. Serves as a reference for
Development by providing a markup pattern library for common UI elements.

Developmnet Lifecycle
=====================

Test your work locally with standard makefile workflow: `make` to build, `make
start` to host, `make run` to poke in a fresh container, `make exec` to poke
into a running one.

source files are placed in `src/css` and `src/js`. Gulp copies them to `public/css` and `public/js`, then minifies them and places the final result into `public/dist`. The full URL for loading the main CSS file is `//styleguide.awin.com/dist/awin.css`

This project is automatically built and deployed with Jenkins
